# Python-Projects-for-Data-Analysis 

This repository contains a collection of practical Python projects in VS Code focused on data analysis, data transformation, data cleaning, preparation, and visualization. The main objective is to work with real world and synthetic datasets and develop structured, end-to-end analytical workflows using industry-standard tools.

The projects in this repository emphasize understanding data deeply before modeling or interpreting results. Each project involves loading and exploring datasets, handling missing values and inconsistencies, performing transformations, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating meaningful insights supported by clear visualizations.

The primary libraries used throughout these projects include NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib for foundational plotting, and Seaborn for statistical visualization. 

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen analytical thinking, improve data handling skills, and build a professional portfolio that demonstrates practical experience in solving data-driven problems using Python.

All projects were developed in the VS Code environment, with version control managed through Git (using Bash). Code was regularly committed and pushed to GitHub via the integrated VS Code extension, ensuring structured version tracking and reproducibility.
Below you can find all the projects included on this repository and their corresponding link sources.

1. fraud_analysis : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isabbaggin/transaction-fraudulent-financial-syntheticdata

     This project demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and fraud analytics using Python. It includes EDA, merchant and customer risk profiling, time-window fraud burst analysis, interaction analysis, and revenue impact assessment on a 10,000-record synthetic dataset. The goal is to showcase structured analytical methodology and fraud investigation techniques.
